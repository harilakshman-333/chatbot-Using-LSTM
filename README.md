# chatbot-Using-LSTM
# **Chatbot using Seq2Seq LSTM models** In this project, we will be using LSTM model using Keras Functional API to build a Chatbot.  The potential of chatbot are vast than we can imagine. We can build a chatbot for a rehab process, digital markeing, Personal assitant, in e-commerce sector, &amp; etc. A very fine example of high-end chatbots are the Siri, Alexa &amp; google assistant.  In this project We use a special recurrent neural network (LSTM) to classify which category the userâ€™s message belongs to and then we will give a random response from the list of responses.


The six stages involved in building this bot
Importing packages
Prepocessing the data
Building Encoder-Decoder model
Training the model
Defining Inference model
Chat with the bot
There are two basic types of chatbot models based on how they are built:
Retrieval Type (A retrieval-based chatbot uses predefined input patterns and responses)&
Generative Type (They are based on seq 2 seq neural networks. It is the same idea as machine translation).
